So what I am going to do with this processor is wander through the
source and figure out what subset of the OpenRisc32 instructions are
implemented.   As well as simply learn the instruction set.

altor32_defs.v (../altor32 directory) contains the defines for the
opcodes supported by this processor.  See the isa.txt file in this
directory which takes these defines and the or32 documentation and
lists the instructions.  Is every nuance of each instruction implemented?
Will see.

The altor32 project comes with an example binary for the software
simulator and to run on the verilator based rtl simulation.  What we
find is the simulator will end if break_o is asserted

    if (_stop_pc == top->dbg_pc_o || top->break_o)
        break;

Which we get from the l.trap instruction

    `INST_OR32_TRAP: // l.trap
    begin
       v_exception = 1'b1;
       v_vector = `VECTOR_TRAP;
       break_o <= 1'b1;
    end

So we need to end with an l.trap to end the sim.

The next thing we see before starting to code is

parameter [31:0]    BOOT_VECTOR     = 32'h00000100;

    unsigned int addr;

    // Read file data in
    int len = fread(buf, 1, size, f);
    buf[len] = 0;

    printf("Loading to 0x%x\n", loadAddr);
    for (addr=0;addr<len;addr++)
        top_load(loadAddr + addr, buf[addr]);


So the .bin file we feed the sim loads starting at address zero but
the boot vector is 0x100, so we need to pad the binary with 0x100 bytes
before our code.

Now we need some tools.  For now just an assembler (and linker)
(TODO, make my own assembler that is less complicated and easier to build)

The OpenRISC folks provide a modified binutils.

http://opencores.org/or1k/OpenRISC_GNU_tool_chain#binutils

svn co http://opencores.org/ocsvn/openrisc/openrisc/trunk/gnu-src/binutils-2.20.1/
cd binutils-2.20.1
./configure --target=or32-elf --prefix=/somewhere
make
sudo make install

You dont have to use the --prefix, I prefer to, perhaps /opt/or32 for
example.  Make is going to take a while.  Once made and installed then
set your path

PATH=/opt/or32/bin:$PATH

Or whatever you put as the --prefix, add /bin if you didnt use --prefix
then it should be in your path already.

Now we can take what we have figured out and write our first program

.space 0x100
l.movhi r7,0
l.addi r7,r7,1
l.addi r7,r7,1
l.trap 0
l.nop
l.nop

Assuming it is named test.s these are the steps to build it into a
.bin file.

or32-elf-as test.s -o test.o
or32-elf-ld -Ttext 0 test.o -o test.elf
or32-elf-objcopy test.elf -O binary test.bin

Using the software simulator:

../or32-sim/or32-sim -t -f test.bin
S 00000100: 00000000 l.j     0                                      flag: 0
S 00000100: 18e00000 l.movhi r7,0            r7         = 00000000  flag: 0
S 00000100: 18e00000 l.movhi r7,0            r7         = 00000000  flag: 0
S 00000104: 9ce70001 l.addi  r7,r7,0x1       r7         = 00000001  flag: 0
S 00000108: 9ce70001 l.addi  r7,r7,0x1       r7         = 00000002  flag: 0
S 0000010c: 21000000 l.trap                                         flag: 0

It appears the pipeline starts out with zeros.  Perhaps the l.j causes the
movhi to run twice, not sure yet.  We definitely see that it does get up
and running and our code runs as desired.  If you run this in the
verilog simulation you see the same behavior (dig down into the cpu then
look at the registers and see r7 increment).

We see there is an l.jal instruction which leads us to think this might
be a mips or mips like processor.  Does that mean the instruction after
the branch executes?  lets find out.

.space 0x100
l.movhi r6,0
l.movhi r7,0
l.addi r7,r7,1
l.j over
l.addi r6,r6,1
over:
l.addi r7,r7,1
l.trap 0
l.nop
l.nop

S 00000100: 00000000 l.j     0                                      flag: 0

Yep, looks like it does execute the instruction after the branch.

Now if we can determine anything about endianness...

.space 0x100
l.movhi r6,0
l.movhi r7,0
l.sw 0(r6),r6
l.addi r7,r7,1
l.addi r7,r7,1
l.sb 0(r6),r7
l.lws r3,0(r6)
l.lwz r4,0(r6)
l.trap 0
l.nop
l.nop

S 00000100: 00000000 l.j     0                                      flag: 0
S 00000100: 18c00000 l.movhi r6,0            r6         = 00000000  flag: 0
S 00000100: 18c00000 l.movhi r6,0            r6         = 00000000  flag: 0
S 00000104: 18e00000 l.movhi r7,0            r7         = 00000000  flag: 0
S 00000108: d4063000 l.sw    0x0(r6),r6      [00000000] = 00000000  flag: 0
S 0000010c: 9ce70001 l.addi  r7,r7,0x1       r7         = 00000001  flag: 0
S 00000110: 9ce70001 l.addi  r7,r7,0x1       r7         = 00000002  flag: 0
S 00000114: d8063800 l.sb    0x0(r6),r7      [00000000] = 02  flag: 0
S 00000118: 88660000 l.lws   r3,0x0(r6)      r3         = 02000000  flag: 0
S 0000011c: 84860000 l.lwz   r4,0x0(r6)      r4         = 02000000  flag: 0
S 00000120: 21000000 l.trap                                         flag: 0

So that looks like big endian.

The next curiocity is that you have a long list of set flag instructions
set flat if equal, set flag if greater than unsigned, etc.  Well the
add instruction, the first one listed in the or32 arch manual says this:

rD[31:0] <- rA[31:0] + rB[31:0]
SR[CY]   <- carry
SR[OV]   <- overflow

The verilog has these defines

`define OR32_SR_CY                               10
`define OR32_SR_OV                               11

But grepping shows that they are not used.

lws and lwz, for a 32 bit processor a bit silly to not have a lw.
the sign extension only applies to a 64 bit processor, but gnu as didnt
accept an lw.  altor32, treats them the same, both are the same.

   `INST_OR32_LWZ, `INST_OR32_LWS: // l.lwz l.lws
        wb_v_reg_result = mem_data_in_i;

set flag...
