So what I am going to do with this processor is wander through the
source and figure out what subset of the OpenRisc32 instructions are
implemented.   As well as simply learn the instruction set.  Even better
perhaps try to document this processor here since it really its own
entity separate from the OpenRISC project.

altor32_defs.v (../altor32 directory) contains the defines for the
opcodes supported by this processor.  See the isa.txt file in this
directory which takes these defines and the or32 documentation and
lists the instructions.  Is every nuance of the or32 instruction set
implemented?  I dont think so, will see.  Being a separate processor
from the or32 project, does it matter if every nuance is implemented?
No, it doesnt matter.

The altor32 project comes with an example binary for the software
simulator and to run on the verilator based rtl simulation.  What we
find is the simulator will end if break_o is asserted

    if (_stop_pc == top->dbg_pc_o || top->break_o)
        break;

Which we get from the l.trap instruction

    `INST_OR32_TRAP: // l.trap
    begin
       v_exception = 1'b1;
       v_vector = `VECTOR_TRAP;
       break_o <= 1'b1;
    end

So we need to end with an l.trap to end the sim.

The next thing we see before starting to code is

parameter [31:0]    BOOT_VECTOR     = 32'h00000100;

    unsigned int addr;

    // Read file data in
    int len = fread(buf, 1, size, f);
    buf[len] = 0;

    printf("Loading to 0x%x\n", loadAddr);
    for (addr=0;addr<len;addr++)
        top_load(loadAddr + addr, buf[addr]);


So the .bin file we feed the sim loads starting at address zero but
the boot vector is 0x100, so we need to pad the binary with 0x100 bytes
before our code.

Now we need some tools.  For now just an assembler (and linker)
(TODO, make my own assembler that is less complicated and easier to build)

The OpenRISC folks provide a modified binutils.

http://opencores.org/or1k/OpenRISC_GNU_tool_chain#binutils

svn co http://opencores.org/ocsvn/openrisc/openrisc/trunk/gnu-src/binutils-2.20.1/
cd binutils-2.20.1
./configure --target=or32-elf --prefix=/somewhere
make
sudo make install

You dont have to use the --prefix, I prefer to, perhaps /opt/or32 for
example.  Make is going to take a while.  Once made and installed then
set your path

PATH=/opt/or32/bin:$PATH

Or whatever you put as the --prefix, add /bin if you didnt use --prefix
then it should be in your path already and you may not need to do this.

Now we can take what we have figured out and write our first program

.space 0x100
l.movhi r7,0
l.addi r7,r7,1
l.addi r7,r7,1
l.trap 0
l.nop
l.nop

Assuming it is named test.s these are the steps to build it into a
.bin file.

or32-elf-as test.s -o test.o
or32-elf-ld -Ttext 0 test.o -o test.elf
or32-elf-objcopy test.elf -O binary test.bin

Using the software simulator:

../or32-sim/or32-sim -t -f test.bin
S 00000100: 00000000 l.j     0                                      flag: 0
S 00000100: 18e00000 l.movhi r7,0            r7         = 00000000  flag: 0
S 00000100: 18e00000 l.movhi r7,0            r7         = 00000000  flag: 0

S 00000108: 9ce70001 l.addi  r7,r7,0x1       r7         = 00000002  flag: 0
S 0000010c: 21000000 l.trap                                         flag: 0

It appears the pipeline starts out with zeros.  Perhaps the l.j causes the
movhi to run twice, not sure yet.  We definitely see that after those
first two instructions, it does get up and running and our code runs as
desired.  If you run this in the verilog simulation you see the same
execution startup, with the 0x100 address instruction executing twice.

We see there is an l.jal instruction which leads us to think this might
be a mips or mips like processor.  Does that mean the instruction after
the branch executes?  lets find out.

.space 0x100
l.movhi r6,0

Yep, looks like it does execute the instruction after the branch.

Now if we can determine anything about endianness...

.space 0x100
l.movhi r6,0
l.movhi r7,0
l.sw 0(r6),r6
l.addi r7,r7,1
l.addi r7,r7,1
l.sb 0(r6),r7
l.lws r3,0(r6)
l.lwz r4,0(r6)
l.trap 0
l.nop
l.nop

S 00000100: 00000000 l.j     0                                      flag: 0
S 00000100: 18c00000 l.movhi r6,0            r6         = 00000000  flag: 0
S 00000100: 18c00000 l.movhi r6,0            r6         = 00000000  flag: 0
S 00000104: 18e00000 l.movhi r7,0            r7         = 00000000  flag: 0
S 00000108: d4063000 l.sw    0x0(r6),r6      [00000000] = 00000000  flag: 0

S 00000110: 9ce70001 l.addi  r7,r7,0x1       r7         = 00000002  flag: 0
S 00000114: d8063800 l.sb    0x0(r6),r7      [00000000] = 02  flag: 0
S 00000118: 88660000 l.lws   r3,0x0(r6)      r3         = 02000000  flag: 0
S 0000011c: 84860000 l.lwz   r4,0x0(r6)      r4         = 02000000  flag: 0

So that looks like big endian.

The next curiocity is that you have a long list of set flag instructions
set flat if equal, set flag if greater than unsigned, etc.  Most of
your conditionals likely come from those, the or32 arch manual mentions
that the add instruction modifies some other bits in the status register.

rD[31:0] <- rA[31:0] + rB[31:0]
SR[CY]   <- carry
SR[OV]   <- overflow

The verilog for altor32 has these defines

`define OR32_SR_CY                               10
`define OR32_SR_OV                               11

But grepping shows that they are not used.  So that implies the add is
like the other alu operations and does not directly affect the status
register, to affect the status register (other than the obvious write
to it) use the "set flag" instructions.

lws and lwz, for a 32 bit processor a bit silly to not have a lw.
the sign extension only applies to a 64 bit processor, but gnu as didnt
accept an lw.  altor32, treats them the same, both are the same.

   `INST_OR32_LWZ, `INST_OR32_LWS: // l.lwz l.lws
        wb_v_reg_result = mem_data_in_i;

I would prefer to see l.lw alias l.lwz, maybe I will dig into binutils
and add that.

So the register based alu instructions are very straight forward.  Like
mips but unlike most other processors you dont use flags on the alu
operations for future conditional branches.  Making these simple and
straight forward.  Also note we dont have a multiply or divide, those
chew up chip real estate which is better recovered with software
solutions.

The immediate instructions have some differences amongst I use simm
to indicate signed immediate (sign extended) and zimm to indicate
unsigned immediate (zero extended).  It is important to note that
the logical operations andi, ori and xori do not match, andi and ori
use a zero extended immediate, xori uses a sign extended immediate.
Like the lwz and lws, talking about sign extension with movhi is a
bit silly for a 32 bit processor, but the or32 folks do it anyway because
they are trying to document both 32 and 64 in one shot.

For this processor the movhi instruction takes the immediate as is and
puts it in the upper bits of the register with the lower bits being zero.

       `INST_OR32_MOVHI: // l.movhi
       begin
           v_reg_result = {v_imm,16'h0000};
           v_write_rd = 1'b1;
       end




---- system on chip (soc) ----

there are peripherals in the rtl from the altor32 project.  Lets look
at the system timer first.



// Peripheral Interconnect
soc_pif
u2_soc
(

    .periph1_wr_o(timer_wr),

so the timer is periph1


in soc_pif.v the address decoder appears to work like this:

always @ (io_addr_i or io_wr_i or io_rd_i or io_data_i)
begin
   // Decode 4-bit peripheral select
   case (io_addr_i[11:8])

   // Peripheral 0
   4'h0 :
   begin

   // Peripheral 1
   4'h1 :
   begin

   // Peripheral 2
   4'h2 :
   begin

and it continues like that so the timer is in io memory space
of

0x.....100

back up to alt_soc.v

    .out2_addr_o(io_address),
    .out2_data_o(io_data_w),
    .out2_data_i(io_data_r),
    .out2_wr_o(io_wr),
    .out2_rd_o(io_rd),
    .out2_pause_i(1'b0),


   case (mem_addr_i[30:28])

   3'b000 :
   begin
       out0_addr_o      = mem_addr_i;

   3'b001 :
   begin
       out1_addr_o      = mem_addr_i;


and so on.


so that is memory space address? x010 for out2. which is I/O memory space

0x20000100 is perhaps where the timer starts.

What does the timer do?  There appear to be two timers, one is the
systick timer, which looks to be counting milliseconds.

reg [31:0]          systick_count;
parameter  [31:0]   CLK_KHZ             = 12288;

       if (systick_clk_count == CLK_KHZ)
       begin
           systick_count     <= (systick_count + 1);
           systick_intr      <= 1'b1;
           systick_clk_count <= 32'h00000000;
       end
       else
           systick_clk_count <= (systick_clk_count + 1);

Every 12288 processor clocks it increments this timer by one.

systick_count is a 32 bit counter so it will just count and roll over,
nice and simple.  Looks to be free running.

Performing a read

       if (rd_i == 1'b1)
       begin
           case (addr_i[7:0])

           // 32-bit systick/1ms counter
           `TIMER_SYSTICK_VAL :
                data_o <= systick_count;

           // Hi res timer (clock rate)
           `TIMER_HIRES :
                data_o <= hr_timer_cnt;


`define TIMER_SYSTICK_VAL       8'h00
`define TIMER_HIRES             8'h04

so reading 0x20000100 that should read the systick timer and
reading 0x20000104 should read the high resolution timer.

the high res timer has two registers one the counter itself the other
a match register

       hr_timer_cnt     <= 32'h00000000;
       hr_timer_match   <= 32'h00000000;

the match register works like this, if not-zero and if the timer
matches, the assert the interrupt line.

       hr_timer_intr <= 1'b0;

       if ((hr_timer_match != 32'h00000000) && (hr_timer_match == hr_timer_cnt))
           hr_timer_intr <= 1'b1;

       // Write Cycle
       if (wr_i != 4'b0000)
       begin
           case (addr_i)

           `TIMER_HIRES :
                hr_timer_match <= data_i;

If you write to offset 0x4 then it will write to the match register.

Running this program

.space 0x100
l.movhi r6,0
l.movhi r7,0
l.movhi r5,0x2000

loop:
l.lwz r4,0x100(r5)
l.andi r3,r4,0x1
l.sfeq r3,r0
l.bf loop

l.addi r7,r7,1
l.addi r7,r7,1
l.trap 0
l.nop
l.nop

It stays in the loop until the system tick timer changes from zero
to one, the strange thing is that happens when systick_clk_count = 0xE000
not when it is 0x3000.





Lets figure the uart out...


The uart is I/O peripheral 0

    // Peripherals
    .periph0_addr_o(uart_addr),
    .periph0_data_o(uart_data_o),
    .periph0_data_i(uart_data_i),
    .periph0_wr_o(uart_wr),
    .periph0_rd_o(uart_rd),

So that means 0x20000000 base address

`define UART_USR                8'h04
`define UART_UDR                8'h08

a write

           `UART_UDR :
           begin
               uart_tx_data <= data_i[7:0];
               uart_wr <= 1'b1;
           end

a read

           `UART_USR :
                data_o <= {27'h0000000, 1'b0, uart_tx_busy, 1'b0, 1'b0, uart_rx_avail};

           `UART_UDR :
           begin
               data_o <= {24'h000000,uart_rx_data};
               uart_rd <= 1'b1;
           end


So the status register, bit 0 is rx_available when set, bit 3 is tx busy when set.
