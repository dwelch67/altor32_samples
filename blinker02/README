This is for the complete systeom on chip, not just the processor.

See blinker01 for toolchain information and how to run the simulator(s).

I modified the peripherals to allow for the hires timer to optionally
count to a value, interrupt and reset, and repeat.  I modified the
interrupt controller to allow for polling of interrupts.  This example
serves to both test and demonstrate these features.

This only works on the rtl simulators (core_simple and core_parallel)
at this time.  The software simulator does not have peripherals (yet).
